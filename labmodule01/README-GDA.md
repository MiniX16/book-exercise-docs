# Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-GDA-* issues (requirements).

### Description

In this module, I set up the development environment for the GDA. I cloned the repository, opened the project in my IDE, and built it using `mvn install -DskipTests` to generate the `.jar` file without running the tests.

Then, I executed the application using `java -jar` to confirm it starts correctly. The setup is complete and ready for future updates and integration.
