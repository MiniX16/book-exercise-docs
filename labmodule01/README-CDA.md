# Constrained Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-CDA-* issues (requirements).

### Description

In this module, I set up the development environment for the CDA. I cloned the repository, created a virtual environment, and updated the `ConfigConst.py` file to use an absolute path for the `PiotConfig.props` file to avoid issues when running the app from different directories.

I also configured the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include both the `main` and `test` folders. Then, I ran the `ConstrainedDeviceApp.py` script to check that everything works properly. This setup is ready for future labs.
